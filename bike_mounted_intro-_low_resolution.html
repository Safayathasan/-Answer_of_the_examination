                <h2>Portable. But Powerful</h2>
                <p>A fire can start anywhere, at anytime. And in just 6 minutes, it can turn into an uncontrollable blaze. This makes it even more 
                    important for you to tackle the fire, before it’s too late.
                    Unfortunately, tiny lanes, inaccessible roads and traffic jams all are a setback when it comes to rushing to the rescue. Which 
                    means that by the time the fire engine reaches the scene of the fire, it could very possibly already be too late.
                    The need of the hour is a fire engine that can manoeuvre any road, zip through traffic and reach the burning premises in 
                    minutes.
                    Ceasefire introduces a state-of-the-art extinguisher on wheels – The Mobile Firefighter. Powered by the world’s most 
                    revolutionary firefighting technology: Watermist.</p>
                    <h2>Watermist Technology and How it Works</h2>
                    <p>Ceasefire’s patented Watermist technology uses the world’s oldest, most effective fire suppressant – water, increasing its 
                        power many times over.
                        Here’s how. Ceasefire extinguishers equipped with Watermist break water down into a fine mist. This mist is then thrown at the 
                        fire with a great kinetic force, covering a large surface area. As soon as the mist comes in contact with the fire, it instantly turns 
                        into steam. Enveloping the flames, cutting down the oxygen supply and reducing the temperature to below combustion levels. 
                        Ensuring that even the largest fire succumbs to Watermist technology. In minutes</p>

                        <h2>The Power of the Ceasefire Mobile Firefighter</h2>
                        <p>With Ceasefire’s Mobile Firefighter on your side, you can arrive at the scene of the fire in minutes, and keep even the largest 
                            fires under control until the fire engines and more help arrives. These unique 9 litre extinguishers, with an extendable hose, can 
                            be mounted onto almost any bike.
                            To add to its firefighting capabilities, two spare containers are also attached. 
                            Increasing the power of this firefighter by four</p>
